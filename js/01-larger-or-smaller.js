//Lager Or Smaller
//Create an application that accepts two integers within two separate prompts. Then, display only the larger of the two within the browser window. Donâ€™t forget to handle the fact that the two could be equal.

// DECLARE TWO VARIABLES
let num1 = parseInt(prompt('Enter the first number: '));
let num2 = parseInt(prompt('Enter the first number: '));

// DISPLAY HEADER
document.write(`<h1>Larger Or Smaller</h1>`);
console.log('Larger Or Smaller');

// CHECK IF NUMBER ARE EQUAL
if (num1 == num2) {
  alert('Numbers cannot be equal, Please try again!');
  document.write(`<h3>Numbers are the same and cannot be evaluated!</h3>`);
  console.log('Numbers are the same and cannot be evaluated');
} else if (num1 > num2) {
  document.write(`<h2>Number 1 has a larger value of: ${num1}</h2>`);
  console.log(`Number 1 has a larger value of: ${num1}`);
} else {
  document.write(`<h2>Number 2 has a larger value of: ${num2}</h2>`);
